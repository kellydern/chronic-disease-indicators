## Data

I used the U.S. [Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)] (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9) data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC provides 124 indicators from states, territories and large metropolitan cities which collect and report on chronic disease data. Since the dataset was too large to use, I took a radom sampling of 1 in ~1,000 data points for these images.
### Timeframe
2008 - 2014

### Chronic Diseases in this Sample
Alcohol, Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Chronic kidney disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Diabetes, Immunization, Mental Health
