###Chronic Disease Indicators Visualization
##Data Visualization of Chronic Disease Indicators in the US

## Data

I used the U.S. [Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)] (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9) data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC provides 124 indicators from states, territories and large metropolitan cities which collect and report on chronic disease data. Since the dataset was too large to use, I took a radom sampling of 1 in ~1,000 data points for these images.
